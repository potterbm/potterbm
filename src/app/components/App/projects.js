      <p>I worked on the <a href="https://munchery.com">Munchery</a> web application for several years. Maintaining and expanding it was definitely a team effort, as it includes their menu, account settings, and checkout process. The whole thing is powered by Angular and Ruby-on-Rails.</p>

    <p>I was excited to work with <a href="http://flyblackbird.com/">Blackbird Airlines</a> because of their simple and clean design aesthetic, and their commitment to getting the details of the projects exactly right. I really enjoyed their focus on making the details of the site delightful for people to experience, and being willing to spend extra time on smaller interactions and animations that aren't obvious at first glance.</p>

<p>In fact, the most fun part of this project were the animations. I got to be involved in the creative process from the beginning concept to the final execution. I've been using CSS to animate SVG elements for a while now (for the logo of this site, actually), but this is the first time I was able to use it for a client and I think it came out really well. Be sure to visit the site to check out the big map animation, and look for the hamburger icon animation as well as the value prop icons.</p>
